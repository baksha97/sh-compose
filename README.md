# Self Hosted Deployment Repository 

This janky repo allows you to use `docker compose` to deploy as many apps as you want on one singular box... you can even deploy multiple GitHub runners!

You can use this on any old Linux box or even a Digital Ocean droplet.

Just configure a GitHub runner for this repo once. (you should not use this on non-self hosted runners)
